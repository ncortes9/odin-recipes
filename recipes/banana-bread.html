            <li>1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon packed dark

            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
                (175 degrees C). Line a 9-x5-inch loaf
                pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch
                overhang on all sides; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Mash 4 of the bananas in a large bowl using
                a fork until mostly smooth to equal 1 1/2 cups.
                Add egs and 1/2 cup brown sugar; still until combined.
            </li>
            <li>Add flour to the banana mixture; stir until just
                combined and no dry streaks remain, scraping down
                the sides of the bowl as needed.
            </li>
            <li>Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan and spread
                into an even layer.
            </li>
            <li>Slice remaining banan in half lengthwise; lay banana
                halves over the top, cut side up. Evenly sprinkle
                remaining 1 tablespoon brown sugar over the top.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden pick
                inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs
                50 to 55 minutes. Let cool in pan on a wire rack for 15
                minutes; using parchment paper overhang.
            </li>
            <li>Remove loaf from pan and slice; serve warm.
