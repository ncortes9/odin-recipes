        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees
                F (190 degrees C). Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with
                parchment paper; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Roll premade pie crust to 1/8-inch thickness on a lightly
                floured work surface, and cut using desired cookie cutter
                shapes.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer cut-outs to prepared baking sheets, leaivng about
                a 1/2-inch space between each cookie. Repeat with remaining
                dough, rerolling scraps once.
            </li>
            <li>Whisk together egg and milk in a small bowl until combined.
                Using a pastry brush, brush the tops of each cookie evenly
                with egg mixture; discard remaining egg mixture. Whisk together
                sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl until evenly combined,
                sprinkle evenly over brushed cookies.
            </li>
            <li>Bake cookies, one baking sheet at a time, in the preheated oven
                until the edges and bottoms of cookies just become golden brown,
                about 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove from oven and brush tops of each cookie lightly with melted
                butter, let cool slightly on baking sheet, about 5 minutes. Serve
                warm. Most importantly, <em>enjoy!</em>
