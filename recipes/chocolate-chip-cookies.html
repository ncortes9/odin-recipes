        <ol>
            <li>Start by gathering your ingredients.
                Make sure your butter is softened, and your
                eggs are room temperature.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to
                350 degree F (175 degrees C). Beat butter,
                white sugar, and brown sugar with an
                electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth.</li>
            <li>Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in
                vanilla.</li>
            <li>Dissolve baking soda in hot water. Add to
                batter along with salt.</li>
            <li>Stir in flour, chocolate chips,
                and walnuts.</li>
            <li>Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased
                baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges
                are nicely browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cool on the baking
                sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool
                completely. </li>
            <li>Finally, <em>store in an airtight
                container or serve immediately and enjoy!</em></li>
